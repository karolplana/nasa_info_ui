# Space Information UI
This repository is for developing an app that uses API requests
and puts them into a UI using streamlit. An API key is necessary
to make use of the APIs, however, the native streamlit secrets 
management is being used to navigate around that. 

----

## Here is a breakdown of the items in the repo:
- **Pages:** Contains the functionalities for the two pages that use the APIs.
  - Image of the day: Queries AOPD API for images
  - Space weather notifications: Queries DONKI API for weather notifications
